Hi!

On this new blog I will talk about software development. I will share things I learned, sometimes the hard way^^, and maybe some thoughts about technology and/or methodology.

The site is powered by [Hugo](http://gohugo.io), a static site generator written in [Go](http://golang.org). I started with it this morning, and I'm really pleased with the result. I can write my posts in markdown, and publish them easily on Github pages, that's (almost) all I need!

A few words about me: I started software development in 1982, at the age of 15. After 12 years working as an automation engineer, I joined the IT industry in 1999. Since 2003 I work for a major Telco operator in France, as a software developer.
